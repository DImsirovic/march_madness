# March Madness
In this project, we analyze differences in performance metrics for collegiate basketball teams that have qualified for March Madness versus those that have not using a variety of Monte Carlo Simulation methods in R. We also build multiple classifier models in Python to predict if a team will qualify for the tournament, given performance metrics in the regular season.
